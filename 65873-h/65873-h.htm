<h1 title=""><i>Art and Pleasure</i>
<br /><span class="smallest"><span class="smallest">&ldquo;Painting With Needles&rdquo;</span></span></h1>
<p>To the Romans who cradled culture, all forms of created beauty constituted Art. Fine
sewing of all kinds, they called &ldquo;Painting with Needles&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today, centuries later, we find millions of American women, those of wealth and those of
more modest means alike, also painting with needles. They are expressing the beautiful
in colorful yarns, and perpetuating culture with their crocheted creations made for the comfort
and pleasure of gracious living.</p>
<p>And it is more than art! Women have learned and are learning how to dress better for
less and how to adorn their homes with practical, yet lovely, articles of usefulness.</p>
<p>Crocheting with Dexter Cotton Warp is, in a sense, the fair flower of an art that our great-grandmas
practiced not alone for pleasure, but with an eye to the practical&mdash;<b>the art of the
weaving of rugs</b>. Their yarns were not so fine and lovely as of today, nor so amazingly
easy to work with. But then, as now, women found pride and delight in the home-arts,
and now crocheting, the art of the hour, flaunts many of the exquisite designs that have
survived those early rugs.</p>
<p>You who love to crochet seek of course the most beautiful and authentic designs, and finest
materials to work with. This Book is for you. In it you will find fascinating variety, and
you will meet as from the pages of history patterns originally conceived by Colonial grandames,
or Spanish senoras, or Bavarian peasants&mdash;designs from all over the world. You
will find the instructions simple and easy to follow. Choose, and know the thrill of superior
crocheting. Save money. And feel free, please, to make us your crocheting headquarters.
We shall always be glad to serve you.</p>

<p class="pcap">DEXTER COTTON WARP, ART. 380</p>
</div>
<p>A Century of Service Weaves Beauty and Long Life Into Your Crocheting!</p>
<p>For one hundred and twenty years women of America have used Dexter Cottons.</p>
<p>A hundred and twenty years ago N.G.B. Dexter dreamed of working magic with cotton,
and he founded his mills in rugged New England to make that dream come true. His were
the first mills in America. Crude the first cotton that came from them, of course, and yet
the Dexter stamp of quality was the guarantee of American women that the yarns they
wove and spun with, American-made, could not be surpassed by any product of the mills
across the seas.</p>
<p>Today American women have that same faith and reliance in the cottons that bear the
name of Dexter. Today as never before, there is fulfillment of his early dream. For
women are working magic with cotton, they are creating beautiful things with soft lustrous
yarns of delicious colors, sensuously lustrous, yet strong and enduring. And today, as
never before, the name of Dexter on yarns carries assurance of unsurpassed quality, of almost
a century and a quarter of continued integrity.</p>
<p>Choose Dexter cottons. They will weave into your crocheting unparalleled beauty, and
retain that beauty far longer than ordinary yarns can promise....</p>

4 s c, repeat from star across handle.</p>
<p>4th and 5th rows&mdash;S c as on other edge. Work 1 row of
picot on each side of handle.</p>
<p>Attach warp to last row of s c in solid part of basket base
and work evenly 14 rows of s c. This brings height of
basket to 2 inches. Ch 3, 3 d c in each of 3 s c, * ch 3,
skip 3, 4 d c in each of 4 s c, repeat around. Next row ch
3, 2 d c in space below, 1 d c in d c below, * ch 3, 1 d c in
1st d c below, 2 d c in space, 1 d c in last d c below, repeat

<p>Make a very thick cooked starch, rub well into basket,
place a glass or can in basket to shape, spread and pull base
until flat and as basket dries stretch the top as much as
possible in one direction to give width and flare to basket.</p>
<p>Let handle dry flat then sew to sides of basket across narrow
width and down on sides of basket about 1&frac12; inches.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
